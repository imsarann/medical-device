    q: 'What is recall?',
    a: 'A correction or removal action taken by a manufacturer to address a problem with a medical device. Recalls occur when a medical device is defective, when it could be a risk to health, or when it is both defective and a risk to health. A medical device recall does not always mean that a patient must stop using the product or return it to the company. A recall sometimes means that the medical device needs to be checked, adjusted, or fixed.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are recall classes?',
    a: 'Class I: A situation where there is a reasonable chance that a product will cause serious health problems or death. Class II: A situation where a product may cause a temporary or reversible health problem or where there is a slight chance that it will cause serious health problems or death. Class III: A situation where a product is not likely to cause any health problem or injury.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What is safety alerts?',
    a: 'Alerts provide important information and recommendations about products. Even though an alert has been issued, it does not necessarily mean a product is considered to be unsafe.

  },
  {
    q: 'What is Field Safety Notice?',
    a: 'Field safety notices are communications sent out by medical device manufacturers or their representatives in relation to actions that they may be taking in relation to their product that is on the market.
